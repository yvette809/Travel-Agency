            <p class ="history">It is no secret that Umea is a city characterised by dark and cold winters.
                Due to this, many immigrants ho come to Umeå have lots of adaptation difficulties. Thefeeling of loneliness and
                isolation often lead to depression. Mr Emmanuel Mukumu a Cameroonian by nationality who has
                lived in Sweden forclose to 12 years have often pondered on how to mitigate this problem
                amongst his African brothers. While feasting in a monthly meetig of Cameroonians in Umeå,
                he mingled with Mr Ojong Roland A Cameroon footballer livin in Umea now since 2016. They Came
                up with the idea of starting a monthly football training amongst Cameroonians living in Umea.
                This initiative was highly welcomed and since then the initiative has spred beyond bounds.
                haven't realised that Wakanda has been a source of joy amongst Cameroonians, the founders
                decided to admit in members from the entire African community. The montly trainings were
                moved to weekly and Wakanda is a proud host of more than 10 African nationalities. We have
                more than 70 registered members including kids and teenagers
